# Supertask

Supertask is a convenience task runner for programming recurrent or otherwise
scheduled jobs, based on the excellent [APScheduler], [FastAPI], [Pydantic],
[SQLAlchemy], and [uv] packages, amongst others.

You can use Supertask to invoke time-driven actions like the venerable [cron]
daemon and the contemporary [systemd timers] are doing it. It can be used both
as a standalone program/service, and as a library.

## Features

- Store jobs in databases supported by SQLAlchemy.
- Supertask aims for [DWIM]-like usefulness and [UX], and provides CLI-,
  HTTP-, and other interfaces.
- Optionally, jobs can be pre-seeded from a JSON file `config.json`, either
  from the local filesystem, or from a wide range of remote locations.
  When using the filesystem, a watchdog monitors the file for changes, in
  order to keep the schedules up to date.

## Status

Please note that Supertask is a work in progress, and to be considered
alpha-quality software. Contributions of all kinds are much welcome,
in order to make it more solid, and to add features.

Breaking changes should be expected until a 1.0 release, so applying
version pinning is strongly recommended when consuming the packages.
