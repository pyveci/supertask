# Supertask

Supertask is a convenience job scheduler based on [APScheduler], [FastAPI],
[Pydantic], [SQLAlchemy], and a few other excellent packages.

You can use Supertask to invoke time-driven actions like the venerable [cron]
daemon is doing it. It can be used both as a standalone program, and as a
library.

Supertask aims for [DWIM]-like usefulness and [UX], and provides CLI-, HTTP-,
and other interfaces.

## Features

- Store jobs in databases supported by SQLAlchemy.
- HTTP API to manipulate the job data model.
- Optionally, jobs can be pre-seeded from a JSON file `config.json`, either
  from the local filesystem, or from a wide range of remote locations.
  When using the filesystem, a watchdog monitors the file for changes, in
  order to keep the schedules up to date.

## Status

Please note that Supertask is a work in progress, and to be considered
alpha-quality software. Contributions of all kinds are much welcome,
in order to make it more solid, and to add features.

Breaking changes should be expected until a 1.0 release, so applying
version pinning is strongly recommended when consuming the packages.
